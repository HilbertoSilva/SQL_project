# SQL_project
My first project on SQL for Udemy Course.

In this project I worked with a generic database from a ficticious company (that can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/znmjrtlae6vt4zi/employees.sql?dl=0).
I performed a number of queries on the database in order to gain some familiarity with SQL. Later I used Tableau to visualize some features of the database.
